# Builder

This python script destroys and recreates the database using [MTGJson](https://mtgjson.com/) as the data source.  

## TODOs
* Conflux images are not ported over thanks to Windows 10 freaking out about the CON folder
* It'd be really nice to have some data validation.
* Additionally I'd like an entity relation diagram of some kind of the underlying database.
