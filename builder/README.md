# Builder

This python script destroys and recreates the database using [MTGJson](https://mtgjson.com/) as the data source.  

## TODOs
* How to enable shorthand argparse arguments?
* Conflux images are not ported over thanks to Windows 10 freaking out about the CON folder
* Stuff to do after the obvious first step of completing the database is complete:
* Clean up unnecessary items that existed prior to normalization.
* It'd be really nice to have some data validation.
* Additionally I'd like an entity relation diagram of some kind of the underlying database.


# Orphaned

* Could make a version of displaycard that shows what it would look like if each field were maximized
* All console work might need to be revisited thanks to omitted sets while building initially.
